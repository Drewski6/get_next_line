                [heuristics heur1,heur2,...]
        after a leak search, shows the list of blocks of <loss_record_nr>
        (or of the range <loss_record_nr_from>..<loss_record_nr_to>).
        With heuristics, only shows the blocks found via heur1,heur2,...

  who_points_at <addr> [<len>]
        shows places pointing inside <len> (default 1) bytes at <addr>
        (with len 1, only shows "start pointers" pointing exactly to <addr>,
         with len > 1, will also show "interior pointers")
  xtmemory [<filename>]
        dump xtree memory profile in <filename> (default xtmemory.kcg.%p.%n)
